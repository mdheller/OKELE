## Datasets ([GoogleDrive](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1Kct8bhw4jmFB9iGggwwTrXvFAphNA9eF))
The following is a guide about data files:

- `synthetic_data/:` Raw value extraction files and ground truth files for popular entities used in the synthetic experiment.
- `real-world_data/:` Raw value extraction files and ground truth files for long-tail entities used in the real-world experiment. For each long-tail entity, properties are predicted with the property prediction model.
